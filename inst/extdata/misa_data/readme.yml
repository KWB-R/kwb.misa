  Description: 20 Critical oxygen events identified at site CHA (sampling site of Senat)
   in MiSa 2. Information about rain and river flow characteristic added. Multple rain
   events can be part of one critical oxygen event. The definition of a rain event is 
   given in the column description of the amount of rain events (R_n). Characteristics of 
   multiple rain events are devided bei "+" as seperator. The rain is based on the 
   rain used for the inforworks simulation (9 rain gauges).
   For the assassment of different decoupling scenarios in MiSa 3 and MiSa 4 only 14 of 20 
   critical oxygen events were selected. The selections was done in the Beginning of
   MiSa 3.
  Columns:
    first column: Event ID
    tBeg: Start of critical oxygen event at CHA
    tEnd: End of crictical oxygen event at CHA
    R_volume: Categorized rain volume per rain event. 
     gering: 5 - <10 mm
     mittel: 10 - <15 mm
     hoch: >15 mm 
    R_intensity: Categorized rain intensity per rain event, based on the maximal
     intensity at one rain gauge.
     gering: <10 mm/h
     mittel: 10 - <30 mm/h
     hoch: >30 mm/h
    R_local: Classification of rain events between local and regional. A rain event is
     classified as local, if at 3 or less than 3 rain gauges the rain amount is at least
     twice as high as the average of the remaining raing gauges.
    R_n: Amount of rain events during the critical oxygen event. A rain event is included if
     1) volume is at least 5 mm and intensity is at least 10 mm/h oder 2) volume is at least
     10 mm at one or more rain gauges. 
    use: Is the rain event used for scenario assessment? The decision was based on the 
     simulated oxygen concentration at CHA. Criterion 1 was a clear impact on the oxygen
     concentration by the cso. Criterion 2 was a sufficiently similar oxygen course 
     compared to measured data, to ensure the quality of the simulation for the extreme 
     events.
    Q_Panke, Q_Spree1, Q_Spree2, Q_LWK, Q_Havel: Flow conditions at the beginning of 
     the simulation of Panke, Spree before Kupfergraben, Spree at Charlottenburg (CHA), 
     Landwehrkanal Unterschleuse and Havel before inflow Spree. The river flow listed
     is the average of the first hour of the Qsim simulation.
    
focus_sites.csv
  Description: Important sites to assess the impact of different decoupling
   scenarios. The sites were partly agreed upon with the Senat in MiSa 1(focus 
   surface waters) and finally defined in MiSa 3.
  Columns: 
    ID: Site IDs
    Name: Complete name
    surface_water: Surface water
    river_km: Distance of the river until the inflow of a receiving water in km
    lon: Longitude of the site
    lat: Lattitude of the site
    Qsim_name: Corresponding site in the output file of the Qsim simulation.
    use: Definition if focus site is used for scenario assassment
 
parameter_conversion.xlsx
  Description: Table used by the interface functions for the conversion of parameter IDs and
  definition of parameters not considered in infoworks but needed for gerris (waterquality)
  Columns:
    parameter: full German Parameter Name
    id_infoworks: parameter ID in Infoworks (mf = mass flow)
    unit_infoworks: unit of the infoworks output (mass flow)
    constant_value: parameters that are not simulated by infoworks and are set to a constant value
      unit is the same as in gerris (see column "unit_gerris")
    id_gerris: parameter ID in Gerris
    unit_gerris: unit needed for Gerris input (concentration)
    min_gerris and max_gerris: tolerated range of parameter in Gerris model
    comment: possibility to add comments (column not used by interace functions)

outlet_conversion.xlsx 
  Description: table used by the interface functions for the conversion of outlet IDs
  Columns:
    outlet_id: Node ID of the outlet within the infoworks model
    upstream_link_id: Infoworks ID of the link leading to outlet (this must be used
      for mass flow information)
    gerris_id: "Randbedingung" used in gerris (provided by Schumacher, Ingenieurbüro 
      für Wasser und Umwelt)
    surface_water: name of the surface water the outlet discharges into
    water_body_km: the water body km where the outlet is located
    y_coordinate and x_coordanite: outlet location in soldner coordinates for Berlin
      (Infoworks export)
    all lat and lon columns: coordinates transformed from Soldner to UTM-Format (ETRS89 DREF91)
    comment: possibility to add comments (column not used by interace functions)  
    
outlet_decoupling.csv
  Description: Decoupling of certain catchments was done in MiSa3 for the "Potenzialanalyse"
   3 regions of Berlin were decoupled, 1) catchments that mainly overflow into the Landwehrkanal 
   (lwk), 2) catchmens that mainly overflow into the eastern part of the Spree (spr) and 3) 
   catchments that mainly overflow into Panke and Berlin-Spandauer Schifffahrtskanal (bsk).
   A 0 in the columns means, those outlet are switched off within the QSim simulation (no overflow).
